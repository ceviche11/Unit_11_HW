# Unit_11_HW

In this project, I was able to resample loan data in order to balance the target classes I was working with. Using SMOTE, Cluster Centroids, SMOTEEN, and Random Over/Undersampling, the models were better able to train on data and make predictions for loan status. 


When it came time to use EasyEnsemble and BalancedRandomForest, I chose a sampling strategy of 1 in order to balance the classes the model was training on. In the end, the models might have been guessing, but balancing out the classes led to a far better result than what I was given.
